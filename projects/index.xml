      <description>In a recent decision to recover my C skills, I decided to work on some smaller projects. One of these projects is supposed to be a file recovery tool that might allow me to recover files that I have accidentally deleted on my Ubuntu machine. To start working on this project, I first had to figure out how files are stored in Linux and what the &amp;lsquo;rm&amp;rsquo; command actually does. Based on this information, I then proceeded to write my C program that searches and recovers the deleted file.</description>
